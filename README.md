# StreetSafe üõ°Ô∏è

Detect unattended bags in real-time for street and public monitoring.

StreetSafe uses **YOLOv8** to detect **backpacks, handbags, and suitcases**, alerting when they are left unattended. It is optimized for street scenarios, ignoring pedestrians walking nearby while monitoring bags that may be left unattended.

## Features

- **Real-time Camera Detection**: Monitor live video feed for unattended bags.  
- **Image Upload**: Test detection on uploaded images.  
- **Street-Friendly Logic**: Ignores pedestrians walking past; detects bags only when unattended.  
- ** ISOLATED‚Üí UNATTENDED Alerts**: Bags are first marked as **ISOLATED**, and if left for more than N seconds (default 5s), marked as **UNATTENDED**.  
- **Clean Display**: No unnecessary bounding boxes for the monitoring region; only detected objects are highlighted.

## Configuration

- **ISOLATED_TIME**: Time in seconds before a bag is marked as unattended.  
- **IOU_THRESHOLD**: Determines how close a person must be to the bag to reset the timer.  
- **PERSON_SIZE_THRESHOLD**: Ignores very small distant people for street detection.  
- **TARGET_CLASSES**: Backpack, handbag, suitcase.
